## GeoJSON Maps
Helpful Links:
[MapShaper](https://mapshaper.org/) and [GeoJSON.io](geojson.io)

Metabase requires each file:
* Be less than 5 MB in size.
* Contain polygon features defining regions (not just points or coordinates)
* Use geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) to define region polygons. Metabase doesn’t support projected coordinates, so you’ll need to convert projected coordinates to geographic coordinates.
* Be accessible by a public URL. Currently, you can’t upload a GeoJSON to Metabase.
